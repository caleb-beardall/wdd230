                <div class="colorObject">
                    <div id="primaryColor"></div>
                    <h3>Primary Color</h3>
                    <p>This color will be used to highlight the site’s important information and interactions, such as
                        headers, menus, and button elements.</p>
                </div>

                    <div id="secondaryColor"></div>
                    <h3>Secondary Color</h3>
                    <p>This color will be used to add diversity to the display of information without pulling attention
                        away from key elements.</p>
